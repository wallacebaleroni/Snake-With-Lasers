# Snake With Lasers

A game inspired by the classic Snake. Developed using PPlay, a game library based on pygame.

## Running The Game

You should have Pygame installed on your computer, to do so simply run this in you console:
'''
pip install pygame
'''
To run the game you have to run the Main.py file located in src/ with a Python interpreter.

## Instruction

* The Snake is controlled by WASD and shoots lasers with SPACE.
* You have to shoot the blocks before consuming them, so you can grow and get power-ups.
* The trick for passing levels is up to you to find out (you should pay atention to the walls).
* The game ends after level 5, so make sure to get the highest score before really finishing the game.

## Screen Capture

Here's a screen capture of the game with basically everything it has to offer:
